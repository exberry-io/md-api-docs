Until now in case one of the symbols is wrong, the entire stream was disconnected.

From now on, in case of wrong symbol stream will continue working for the valid symbols and for the invalid symbols the message returned will be:

```json
{
  "q": "v1/exchange.marketdata/lightTickers",
  "sid": 10,
  "d": {
    "symbol": "Ins1",
    "bidQuantity": 0,
    "askQuantity": 0,
    "timeStamp":1675769165802,
    "errorCode": 3,
    "errorMessage": "Wrong symbol" 
  }
}
```

This error might occur in case that stream is already working (in case symbol is no longer active instrument).

## 2023-01-18

[market-data.md](../market-data-apis/market-data/market-data.md "mention") will publish events only in case there is change in data. Once there is change- it will be sent only when interval time elapsed.

## 2023-01-03&#x20;

All API has a new optional header parameter - we strongly recommend to use it instead of the previous `environments.exchangeNum`  (which is still supported), the new parameter provides more accurate and efficient instrument discovery.&#x20;

The parameter is called `token` and can be retrieved from Admin application under home page:
